To create the HTML documentation, there are two options:
1) Standard Javadoc
	* execute "ant -f javadoc"
	* the documentation will be created in the the "doc" folder
2) "DroidDoc"
	* place the opennfc directory (the directory where this README file is stored) in the "external" directory of the Android source code tree
	* execute "mm opennfc_library-docs"
	* the documentation will be created in the ../../out/target/common/docs/opennfc_library folder
